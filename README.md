# The Renegades of Silicon Alley

## Renegade Trailbrews is a brand new app to combine the wonders of nature and a love of a great craft beer. 

### Description: This App is the perfect accessory to the avid outdoors person that also likes to enjoy the local area for some refreshments after their day on the mountain! With the Renegade Trailbrew App, the user will be able to enter a city and state and the app will do the rest! In just seconds the user will have all the best hiking trails within a certain radius of the location of interest. In addition, you will  also be able to search trails by difficulty, minimum and maximum distance and rating.

### But wait, there's more! This app will also retrieve information about any local breweries and eateries near the trails you plan to take on during the day. That way, when you're exhausted and sweaty you won't have to search for a delicious cold beer and some totz because they will already be on your agenda!

### Given more time to develop the app, we would offer local businesses the opportunity to market themselves on our platform due to the fact that our users are a very specific market. Also, we would tie in a more comprehensive location service that actively tracks ones location and pings the user when they were within a certain radius of a trail or kayaking location they may not have known about previously. The app will be able to track the users activity history in addition to allowing the outdoors person to save favorite activities, rate their activities, take notes and upload images for each respective activity.

### This was the first project with 4 of us working together. Not only was it more practice with APIs, it was also a chance to work with others in a tech setting.
